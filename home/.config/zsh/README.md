# Zsh Custom Configs

This folder contains the custom zsh configs I have added.
This includes startup scripts, exports, alias etc.
This is done using `oh-my-zsh` `ZSH_CUSTOM` variable.  

You can think of these `.zsh` files being loaded and being in the zshrc file itself.
The zshrc file itself still has some configs, namely `oh-my-zsh` configs and configs dealing with plugins and themes.  

The `examples` files are left here for additional information.
This was taken from the `oh-my-zsh` repo on 29/03/2021.  

Note that the custom plugins and themese should be installed here now.
For now these are:
```
Themes:
- Powerlevel10k

Plugins:
- zsh-syntax-hightlight
```
