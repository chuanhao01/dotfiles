# Dotfiles

This is my, [@chuanhao01](https://github.com/chuanhao01), linux dotfile configuration.
This is mainly for my current setup of arch linux, running i3-gaps as my window manager and alacritty as my temrinal emulator of choice.
For more information on how my setup is like you can refer to the sections below.
If you want to find out how one part of my configuration works, you can look at the config file or the `README` document in the folder.
