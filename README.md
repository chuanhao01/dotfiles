# Dotfiles

This is my, [@chuanhao01](https://github.com/chuanhao01), linux dotfile configuration.
This is mainly for my current setup of arch linux, running i3-gaps as my window manager and alacritty as my temrinal emulator of choice.
For more information on how my setup is like you can refer to the sections below.
If you want to find out how one part of my configuration works, you can look at the config file or the `README` document in the folder.

## Quick Explaination
The `home/` folder where you will find most of my configurations.
You can think of it as a representation of how my `home` directory looks like.  
The `README` document in the `home/` folder will go into more detail as to how my configuration works and each part of it.  

As for the other folders in the `root` directory here, they are mainly for my own use, or are `README` documents like this one.  

A quick visual aid:
